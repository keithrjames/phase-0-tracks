#Release 0
# Method to create a list
# input: string of items separated by spaces (example: "carrots apples cereal pizza")
# steps:
  # split the string into an array separated by spaces
  # set default quantity to one and add it into our list
  # print the list to the console
# output: print the hash shopping list

# Method to add an item to a list
# input: item name and optional quantity
# steps: add the grocery item as a item and quantity pair to shopping list
# output: print the updated hash shopping list

# Method to remove an item from the list
# input: item the user wants to remove
# steps: take item to symbol and
#                   - If it's in the list then delete it if it is
# output: print the new modified shopping list

# Method to update the quantity of an item
# input: item the user wants to update and quantity
# steps: - If it's there and then update new quantity by setting the key to new quanityt
# output: print the new modified shopping list

# Method to print a list and make it look pretty
# input: takes in the shopping list hash
# steps: iterate through each key/value pair
# output: print a clean list to user

#Driver Code to Test:
food = "carrots apples cereal pizza"
shopping_list = create_list(food)
p add_item("cheese", 2, shopping_list)
p remove_item("carrots", shopping_list)
p update_item("pizza", 5, shopping_list)
p print_list(shopping_list)

#Reflection:
#It's extremely important to be detailed on what exactly you want the code to do. It makes it a lot easier to organize the actual code being written.
# Hashes allow you to assign key value pairs which is extremely useful when overriding or reassigning values, iterating over an array to make the keys did require an additional step where we broke the strings up but it worked well.
# A method returns an implicit value if no explicit return method is called, in each of our methods we called upon the print method to return the newly modified list.
# You can pass any object into a method as an argument, even assign the result of a method to a variable which can then be passed in as an argument
# You can pass information between methods by using a variable as the same parameter/argument for each method, i.e. here we had shopping_list assigned to the result of create_list which was called upon by different methods. Also by calling a method within another method calls the result from that method.
# This challenge solidifed how methods can be called upon each other, and global variables can be iterated upon by the same methods multiple times without declaring a new hash each time.
