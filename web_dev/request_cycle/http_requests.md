1. What are some common HTTP status codes?

200 - OK/Success
301 - Moved Permanently
305 - Use Proxy
403 - Forbidden
404 - Not Found
408 - Request Timeout

2. What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?

A GET method requests data from a specified resource. You can use a GET method to simply return a web page. GET methods are also good for when you want the URL to be obvious and discoverable.

A POST method submits data to a specified resource. You should use a POST method for destructive actions such as creating, editing, and deletion.

3. Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?

From Wikipedia:

An HTTP cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie or simply cookie) is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored in the user's web browser while the user is browsing. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information (such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store) or to record the user's browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, logging in, or recording which pages were visited in the past). They can also be used to remember arbitrary pieces of information that the user previously entered into form fields such as names, addresses, passwords, and credit card numbers.

Cookies are arbitrary pieces of data, usually chosen and first sent by the web server, and stored on the client computer by the web browser. The browser then sends them back to the server with every request, introducing states (memory of previous events) into otherwise stateless HTTP transactions.
