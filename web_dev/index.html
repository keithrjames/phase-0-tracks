    <h1>Categories of B-boying (a.k.a Break-dancing)</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>B-boying</strong> is well known for its incredible feats of strength and balance, but that is not the only piece of this <em>varied</em> style of dance. There are 3 basic components to B-boying:
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Uprock:</strong> The movement the dancer preforms while standing, most comparable to conventional dances</li>
        <li><strong>Downrock:</strong> The movement a bboy preforms on the ground, usually on the hands in feet in circular motion of some variation</li>
        <li><strong>Power Moves/Freezes:</strong> The moves that come to mind when you imagine breakdancing, these are moves and poses routed in being difficult to pull off and are incredibly flashy</li>
      </ol>
      These are just the basic elements of course, and there are many more elements such as:
      <ul>
        <li>transitions</li> 
        <li>moves borrowed from other dance styles</li>  
      </ul>
