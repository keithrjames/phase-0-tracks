Reflection:

I think overall I learned that I need to see demonstrations in order to understand concepts. At first, I was reading a lot about jQuery, but I didn't have a visual understanding of what I was reading. It was only until the videos that I started to understand how to incorporate the material into a practical application. I also found a very nice cheatsheet for jQuery commands.
