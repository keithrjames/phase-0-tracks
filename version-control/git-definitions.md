What is version control? Why is it useful? Version control is a system for tracking code changes and keeping a record of what changes happened when, so that if there is an issue or a need to revert to a previous version, you can do so relatively easily while addressing the issue at hand.
What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is essentially a copy of your current project, but doesn't affect your original master document. This allows anyone to make changes in the branch and potentially improve or add new features independently of the master document, meaning you can use it as a way to test new ideas, revamp obsolete code, or just tinker with some elements of the code without causing issues in the original.
What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is taking changes to a repository and making them a permanent part of the version history by using the commit command. A good commit message is one that succinctly describes the changes made to all code in that commit.
What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is a situation where a branch cannot be merged back into the master document, as there are outstanding differences between the two branches, such as the master branch having changes that are not reflected in the branch being merged.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? version control is the workflow practice of maintaining a master version of a file and only doing development on features of the file to be later integrated into the master version. This is useful because it allows for a SW Dev team to always have an untarnished version of their file in case mistakes are made.
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is a feature of version control that allows a user to develop on a file, but not do any actual work on the master copy. Developers use branches to add features to a particular project. This allows for mistakes to be made, or features to be created without compromising the master document. If one of the features is not working, the team can always go back to the untarnished master file.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is the step after staging a document. This is when the document is actually saved into the repository. A good commit message explains the specific changes that were made to the file.
* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is when two separate branches make different changes to the same line of code and those branches are merged together.

* new words!!!
