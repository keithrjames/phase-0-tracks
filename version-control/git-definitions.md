# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

What is version control? Why is it useful? Version control is a system for tracking code changes and keeping a record of what changes happened when, so that if there is an issue or a need to revert to a previous version, you can do so relatively easily while addressing the issue at hand.
What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is essentially a copy of your current project, but doesn't affect your original master document. This allows anyone to make changes in the branch and potentially improve or add new features independently of the master document, meaning you can use it as a way to test new ideas, revamp obsolete code, or just tinker with some elements of the code without causing issues in the original.
What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is taking changes to a repository and making them a permanent part of the version history by using the commit command. A good commit message is one that succinctly describes the changes made to all code in that commit.
What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is a situation where a branch cannot be merged back into the master document, as there are outstanding differences between the two branches, such as the master branch having changes that are not reflected in the branch being merged.
