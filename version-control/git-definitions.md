# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? version control is the workflow practice of maintaining a master version of a file and only doing development on features of the file to be later integrated into the master version. This is useful because it allows for a SW Dev team to always have an untarnished version of their file in case mistakes are made.
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is a feature of version control that allows a user to develop on a file, but not do any actual work on the master copy. Developers use branches to add features to a particular project. This allows for mistakes to be made, or features to be created without compromising the master document. If one of the features is not working, the team can always go back to the untarnished master file.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is the step after staging a document. This is when the document is actually saved into the repository. A good commit message explains the specific changes that were made to the file.
* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is when two separate branches make different changes to the same line of code and those branches are merged together.
