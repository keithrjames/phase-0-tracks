          <li>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful? <strong>From what I gathered, semantic tags do not really change the display of the content put between the tags. It is more for classification and structure of an HTML document. I think the Main tag is the most useful because it defines what content is unique to a particular page.</strong></li>
          <li>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page? <strong>I am not entirely sure what this question is asking. If we are talking about a general hierarchy, I would say main/header/article/section/aside/footer, but even that is loose. The only thing that is firm is that the main element can not descend from another semantic elemnt.</strong></li>
          <li>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? <strong>Sublime is great! It is very flexible and helpful for auto-populating files. I also love the snippet feature. I think I will use snippets a lot because I am seeing that there are so many repetitive tasks with coding.</strong></li>
          <li>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? <strong>Honestly, trying to get a firm definition of the semantic elements. It appears as if there really aren't any! I will just have to do more research.</strong></li>
